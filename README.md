## Getting Started (Local)

1. **Clone the repo** (after you create it on GitHub):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. **Open locally**
   - Option A: Just open `index.html` in your browser.
   - Option B (recommended): Use a local static server for smoother asset loading, e.g. VS Code Live Server or:

   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```

3. Scroll through the site and enjoy the animations.

## Deploying to Vercel

Once this folder is pushed to a GitHub repo:

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and **import the repository**.
2. Framework preset: **Other** (this is a plain HTML/CSS/JS site).
3. Set the **root directory** to the project folder if needed.
4. Deploy – `index.html` will be used as the entry point.

After deployment, you’ll get a live URL you can put on your resume and profiles.
